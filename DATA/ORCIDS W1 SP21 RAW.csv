Either I use it in the beginning of the lesson where I present a scenario about the math we are learning and ask them all to tell me one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. We often use DESMOS as our platform for sharing so they are to put one of each and they we look at what others have posted and use it as a launching point to the lesson. Recently we were looking at graphing systems and used this to make notice and wonder about the graphs of systems that we were looking at the mid point of the lesson.</p>,Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,kcunningham@phoenixunion.org,Kristine,Cunningham,

I often use notice and wonder, or which one doesn't belong, or what is the same, what is different. It really allows students to communicate with each other, either via a schoology discussion, during a google meet, or in person in class. We just returned to in person instruction last week for the first time since 3/9/20 so students were really excited to talk to me and to each other. I included a picture of the notice and wonder we did last week as we are just starting a short unit on circles, then moving into transformations and tesselations. Modeling your expectations helps students understand - but they really like it and by this point in the year they get kind of mad if I don't do it.</p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,kimberley.nichols@spps.org,Kimberley,Nichols,

<br> 
<p>Every year my students are learning how to participate in mathematical discussions.  This is a great way to teach students how to talk about math in a safe way since there are no expectations and no wrong answers. I am trying to move to more of a group conversation where students respond to each other rather than a student commenting and I am the one responding. </p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,susan.sullivan@perkins.org,Susan,Sullivan,

I use it as an introduction to contextual (word problems),recognizing and solving patterns and discovering rules. What students notice and wonder helps with mathematical discourse and the logic behind their solution strategy.  For my students, these activities help to demonstrate that their are multiple valid methods to solve a problem. The technique also helps broaden students conceptual thinking. As students share, other students discover aspects that were not identified previously. </p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,tujuanagh@yahoo.com,Hinton,Tujuana,

<p>So I sometimes will use this routine when asking students to do some initial sensemaking about something, and find it to be a productive initial scaffold that gets kids looking for patterns/structure/salient features and asking mathematical questions and/or making conjectures. For example, in a course that I've taught that focuses on the mathematics of perfect shuffles, the students are asked to build a table (n, o(n)) that tracks the number of out-shuffles, o(n), as a function of the deck size, n. The first few values of o(n) (for n even) are 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 10, 12, 4, 8, 18, 6, 11, ... Asking students to notice and wonder creates really productive discussion - students have all sorts of conjectures about how to predict additional entries in the table, almost always expressed in terms of the elementary functions they are familiar with (polynomials, exponentials, etc).</p> 
<br> 
<p>All that having been said, I tend to think of N&amp;W as just one tool in the toolkit for orienting kids towards mathematical structure, and I tend to use it less as we get deeper into a problem.</p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,jtbrasel@umich.edu,Jason,Brasel,

STEM_ORCHIDSSP21_mlc439,ORCIDS SP2021 Workshop,84736,4/20/21 21:32,4/20/21 21:32,Notice and wonder,"<p>I have used Notice and Wonder as a way of immediately engaging students in a lesson. I like how everyone can notice something. My district uses OpenUp Math for our middle school curriculum and noticing and wondering are built into the student tasks, usually as the opener of a lesson. Even before using this curriculum it was a great way to begin 3 act math tasks. I would write or have students write everyones noticings and wonderings on the board. If students are reluctant to share I have them write their responses on a small white board and hold hold them up for the class to see. The more I did noticing and wondering with a class, the more details they started to see and the more questions would come up. After a &quot;phone in the pocket&quot; experiment recording my interactions with students groups, I have extended the notice and wonder to include, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;</p> 
<br> 
<p>This year though has been a huge challenge. We are hybrid and students are very reluctant to share on our virtual lesson. Even my in-person students barely speak up. It feels like a huge step backward and I cannot wait to get back to having discussions again.</p>

<br> 
<p>Now I use notice &amp; wonder through the Desmos platform.  I'm using the Desmos version of the 7th grade math Open Up/Illustrative Math curriculum, so a lot of notice &amp; wonder slides are built right into daily lessons.  I find that the routine is best when most information is removed and students have more to notice and wonder about.  </p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,vicklauren@gmail.com,Victoria,Cavanaugh,
STEM_ORCHIDSSP21_mlc439,ORCIDS SP2021 Workshop,84738,4/20/21 22:07,4/20/21 22:07,Noticing and Wondering,"<p>I actually just recently heard of Noticing and Wondering - actually by our new district math coach, who referred me to this program! She used it on our most recent district walk-through. It was really nice to hear it as a teacher, because it felt like she wasn't trying to &quot;catch us&quot; doing the wrong thing. Instead, she was interested in our feedback about things that she saw during her visit. It got us thinking.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I haven't used the terms &quot;notice&quot; and &quot;wonder&quot; specifically with my students, though I do tend to subscribe to the Socratic method - using questions to probe students' thinking. I actually feel like this strategy would work really well with my current practice, and invites students to feel empowered by their work. It encourages them to think more deeply about it and to reflect on it in ways that they may not have originally. This is particularly helpful when assessing work, or having conferencing and small group sessions. It could even be used as a prompt for a math talk at the start of class...pose a problem, then notice and wonder. Or...pose a problem, then ask the students to notice and wonder. It reminds me of the thinking behind Three Act Math Tasks.</p>",Module 1 - Part 1: Reflections on Noticing and Wondering,,,pratser_d@hcsb.k12.fl.us,Devon,Pratser,

<br> 
<p>I love the curiosity!  Thanks for asking about this.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Desmos is really fantastic about making their tool accessible to students with visual impairments.  Students can use a screen reader (JAWS or NVDA) to hear what is on the computer screen.  The graph is 'read' to them with sonification.  To use the braille option a student would attach a refreshable braille display to the computer and the text would be represented on the student's device in braille.  A student could also use their regular computer keyboard to enter the braille (this is called 6 key entry), and then use the screen reader to hear it back.  </p> 
<br> 
<p>Each braille character is made up of a combination of 6 cells.  If you google refreshable braille display you will see that there is a series of these 6 dot cells that keep being refreshed as a person reads. </p> 
<p><br>Finally, there is Nemeth and UEB braille which are two different math languages.  Nemeth has been around for a very long time and in the past few years, UEB has been adopted to standardize how braille is written in English speaking countries.  Students in the US use both codes, depending on the state they live in.</p> 
<br> 
<p>That's a lot of information and I hope I explained it well.  Here is a link if you want to see some videos and get a more professional explanation.  I am always happy to explain how my students do math so feel free to ask any questions! </p>

<p>I teach prealgebra, and I sometimes use Notice &amp; Wonder just the way you mentioned at the beginning of lessons in Desmos.  One wondering I have is where you go from there, specifically in Desmos.  Sometimes, I'll choose the option in Desmos where students can see three of their classmates' remarks.  Other times I use the snapshot tool to select and sequence students' work. However, I'd love to make the discussion feel more authentic by not over-organizing what students say.  I'm curious how you use it as a launch.</p>

I think this warm-up helps students feel like they have something to contribute to a mathematical discussion without the pressure of feeling like they might get an answer wrong. Students noticed that some were missing, students came up with different ways to count the cookies and they wondered what happened to the missing cookies.  At the beginning of the year, I really try to find pictures that students will find engaging and will generate discussion.</p>

Someone else had to point that out to me before I fully realized it. In my mind when presented with the Eating Contest, I wanted to know how many green beans Caleb ate, even if the question did not ask it. I did realize from the write-up that there would not be one right answer. I also wanted to see what patterns would emerge and what I would learn by looking at the number of green beans Caleb ate.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I wrote equations for each person's green bean amount and used those equations to fill in a table when Caleb at 1 - 20, 40, and 100 green beans. I had some more wondering (Could the answer include Sol eating 1/2 a green bean?) and more noticing (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place changed and there were patterns).  It also confirmed that there were many possible solutions to the scenario.</p>

Once I read through the scenario a few times I was able to create formals or mathematical relationships based on Caleb for the other 3 people in the scenario. I tried several times to &quot;solve&quot; this particular math problem, but came up with questions about how you determine exactly what the word &quot;impressive&quot; means - and how to atttibute a number to that descriptive word. </p> 
<br> 
<p>I tried some different values for Caleb - and then started to think about different age groups - would it be better to be talking about eating an impressive amount of skittles or something more related to students (depending on age). I wanted to see if I saw any patterns in the numbers - maybe graphing them to see if a visual pattern emerges that could give a more blanket statement about what happens when Caleb eats different impressive amounts of green beans. Who defines impressive? There is a part of math that requires justification - why is your thought that 100 beans is impressive more valuable than anothers' thought that 5 beans is impressive (if you hate green beans - that is impressive). </p> 
<br> 
<p>Sense-making to me has traditionally meant an ability to solve a problem, but as I focus less on procedural mathematics and more on deepening understanding, the sense-making becomes an important piece. This could be a fun activity for students - although, if they are like me, they will be annoyed because there isn't a &quot;solution&quot;</p>",Module 2 - Part 3 DB,,,kimberley.nichols@spps.org,Kimberley,Nichols,
STEM_ORCHIDSSP21_mlc439,ORCIDS SP2021 Workshop,84822,5/1/21 22:52,5/1/21 22:52,Eating Contest Problem,"<p>When solving the Eating Contest problem, I first thought about translating the words into algebraic expressions.  I felt comfortable doing this, especially because this is at the heart of seventh grade math, and we just finished our expressions and equations unit, but I was also thinking about how students who were less comfortable with translating words to algebraic expressions (or just mathematical sentences in general) might feel.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I then used the expressions to test some &quot;benchmark&quot; numbers.  I was thinking about the discussion via Zoom and in breakout rooms, and realized how helpful discussing the problem was in thinking about solving the question my group came up with.  For example, I thought a lot about what &quot;impressive&quot; meant as another person had raised the significance of this term in relation to the contest.  I was also thinking about fairness of the contest itself - there was a lot of information we didn't know about the contestants, so maybe &quot;ranking&quot; them wasn't really the point.  Finally, though I used substition to solve the problem, I realized that making a table or a graph would have been great scaffolds and visuals for students, especially when thinking about &quot;tipping points&quot; (the moments when one participant overtook another in the contest).</p> 
<br> 
<p>One &quot;hidden&quot; decision I made when solving the questions of who ate the most and who ate the least was to not deal with fractional green beans.  This could be an interesting discussion for students.  Is a green bean counted as &quot;1&quot; even though it might be larger or smaller than another green bean.  What if they are &quot;broken&quot;?  I dealt mostly with even numbers so that 1/2's would always be &quot;whole&quot; numbers.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Lastly, I would love to think with students about the &quot;merits&quot; and &quot;themes&quot; of this story.  What does it mean for Caleb if the more green beans he eats (based on the scenario) the more likely he is to end up in &quot;last&quot; place?</p>",Module 2 - Part 3 DB,,,vicklauren@gmail.com,Victoria,Cavanaugh,

<br> 
<p>I was really intrigued when I discovered that the actual ranking of the students changed depending on Caleb's impressive X not just once or twice, but five times!</p> 
<br> 
<p>I know there was no actual question posed, but after reading the story, I wanted to know how the eaters compared to each other, and most students would also go down this line of thought.  Other questions that came up though included why green beans?  You just watched a hot dog eating contest and green beans is what you went with?  Was it all on a dare then and none of them liked green beans at all?  Did one of them secretly like green beans and dared the others knowing they didn't?  I could see all kinds of conversations being had like this, the social emotional component of the problem, and getting students engaged with it.  Thus, the other &quot;hidden&quot; component of the problem is the definition of the word &quot;impressive.&quot;  Well, I googled how many green beans is in a serving, and it's only 20.  Given that the ranking doesn't change after 60 green beans anymore, I am calling &quot;impressive&quot; anything &gt; 60.  I'd probably be inclined to say 100 is impressive, but they did only have 5 minutes to eat, so &gt; 60 is probably enough to qualify.</p>",Module 2 - Part 3 DB,,,dr.dlmckinn@gmail.com,David,McKinney,

<br> 
<p>Next, I expressed the quanties eaten as algebraic expressions and thought about the ramifications if Caleb ate 0 to 7 beans, as well as if he consumed an odd number of beans.

<br> 
<p>I love the norm of starting with &quot;doing something.&quot;  Personally, my go to is always taking brief notes on the problem - writing down key details.  It helps me feel like things are in motion.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I also like the idea of starting with numbers like 10 and noticing and wondering from there.  It reminds me of the strategy of then thinking about &quot;too big&quot; and &quot;too small&quot; of a number as a way to work towards the solution.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Finally, I think it is really important to try to take the perspective of our students (&quot;thinking like a 6th grader&quot;). I find it helps me be more aware of where they might go with a given problem, rather than my over-reliance on strategies they haven't been taught yet.  Sometimes I wonder if the &quot;easier&quot; way of doing things algebraically is actually a dis-service to students in the sense that for some, who become quickly frustrated by algebraic expressions, they may also lose the innate ability and wonder/way to approach the problem they may have had when younger.  I'm often impressed when I work with 4th or 5th  graders who seem much more willing to &quot;jump&quot; into problems than some of the 7th graders who I teach.  Some of the 7th graders are so worried about being wrong that it seems to paralyze them. . .which brings us back to your intial point of just doing something. :)</p>",Module 2 - Part 3 DB,84823,84823,vicklauren@gmail.com,Victoria,Cavanaugh,

<p>I loved one comment that 'a student noticed something while finding the answer'. I thought that was great feedback for a student to hear.

<br> 
<p>Justin commented that jumping to solution strategies that seem natural to us often doesn't help us support a wider range of student thinking.&nbsp; When we were writing the Problems of the Week at the Math Forum, we got together weekly for Math Monday (usually on Monday, but not always) and solved potential problems.&nbsp; These ranges from the Math Fundamentals PoWs (the ""funpows""), which targeted grades 3-5, to trig/calculus.&nbsp; Many of the funpows could be quickly solved with algebraic techniques, but of course, kids in grades 3-5 aren't so likely to pull out algebraic techniques.&nbsp; So it became a personal challenge to solve every funpow as many ways as you can think of without algebra. Not surprisingly, this gets a lot easier with practice!&nbsp; While algebra had always been my reflex before, I'm now a lot more flexible in my thinking and approaches to all sorts of problems.</p> 
<br> 
<p>In a reply to Dianne, David comments about how cool it would be to let kids come up with their own problems to answer, much like we asked you to do.&nbsp; Given an appropriate prompt (one that might elicit math related to the math goals you have for your students at the time), that's really doable.&nbsp; I've often had teams of students vote for the wonderings they think would be interesting or challenging to answer, and then we use the winner as our focus, with non-winners being additional tasks for some groups who are interested.&nbsp; I'd say confidently that, other than this one time I used a bad prompt, I have never had kids not wonder the exact thing I wanted them do.&nbsp; Other regular users of Notice &amp; Wonder report the same thing.</p> 
<br> 
<p>In a related idea, Devon pondered the possibility of using the same story at different grade levels.&nbsp; That so totally works!&nbsp; In fact, we once worked with a district that used the same prompt in grades K-8 and then compared results.&nbsp; First thing you will notice is that younger kids know a TON of math they haven't been ""taught"", and that they have lots of math ideas.&nbsp; Many prompts lend themselves to a variety of mathematical goals, and it's super interesting to see what your students come up with.</p> 
<br> 
<p>From a personal math angle on this problem, I would so use a spreadsheet, especially if I was thinking of non-algebraic methods.&nbsp; I do NOT want to do the arithmetic to recalculate everything based on different numbers of beans for Caleb, but if I teach a spreadsheet the relationships, I can try lots of possible starting numbers.&nbsp; This might help me notice patterns and will avoid my propensity to make arithmetic errors!</p>",Module 2 - Part 3 DB,,,anniefetter@gmail.com,Annie,Fetter,

 I found that in many cases, my peers and I had very similar noticings and wonderings. We focused on the most fundamental areas of need to help students enhance their responses. I was the only one who commented asking a student about the extra problem. From the looks of it, one of my peers may not have realized that the actual word problem students responded to was included in the space. Some of the noticings and wonderings led me to that conclusion. One of my peers did not comment on any student work. Some of my peers focused on commenting about the student work, whereas I commented to the students about their work. One particular group member, though, added a piece to their comments that really stood out to me. In many instances, they made of point of acknowledging and encouraging the student about their processes, bringing an element of SEL support to the activity. I thought this was a great way to show value in the students' thoughts and ideas. They used phrases like, &quot;I notice and appreciate.&quot; Other phrases they used were &quot;hidden decisions&quot; to describe work that was clearly considered by the student, but not necessarily explained thoroughly. I could also tell that they attended to the K-12 math practices in their responses. For example, they noticed that a student &quot;persevered&quot; in solving the problem. I love their take in doing it this way because they addressed the gaps to help lead to more fully developed responses, but also provided support from the SEL standpoint. Most of the comments did not specifically tell students what to do, or what errors may have been made, but asked guiding questions to highlight thinking that may lead them to a new noticing.

<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;""> 
 <li style=""list-style-type: inherit;"">What was it like to see someone else's lens on student work? 
</ul> 
<br> 
<p>For the most part, my group members' comments on what they noticed/wondered were in the same vein as mine.  We pretty much picked out the same things to highlight and select from each student, and we had the same comments essentially, even right down to noticing the lack of parentheses in one student's work after the first and into the second line (Cheyenne).  The other collaborator who seems to be done commenting on student's works also commented on this particular student and asked a question about it:  was it a set-up issue or an execution issue?  I would also take this approach if I were in the classroom and the student showed me the work.  That's pretty much the question I would ask her.  So for me, seeing others' lenses on student work really reinforces my own approach and perspective since we shared so much in common.</p>

</ul> 
<br> 
<p>I'll phrase this in the sense of notice and wonder here as well because any other way I try and say it sounds negative in some way.  I hope everything comes through in a neutral sense with the notice/wonder form.  I notice that I wrote both notice and wonders for each student, several for some of them in fact.  I notice that my other collaborators must have gone through and thought about key themes across ALL students' works, then picked those out that happened across the students as a whole, and highlighted and commented on those instead of repeating themselves over and over from student to student.  I wonder if I can be as effective in my communications by being more succinct and doing less?</p>

<p>This has already been discussed above for the most part.  My collaborators and I really noticed all the same things, right down to where the mistakes were made in Cheyenne's work and the use of color in Destiny's work.  I did notice one thing that no one else seemed to comment on, so that difference would be that I took into consideration if students were working alone or in groups.  In my classroom, I allow students to self-sort when it comes time for these types of problems.  Some prefer to work alone and others really prefer working in groups.  So noticing this from the students' write-ups is an extension of the things I pay attention to in class.</p>",Module 3 - Part 2: Reflecting on EnCoMPASS DB,,,dr.dlmckinn@gmail.com,David,McKinney,
STEM_ORCHIDSSP21_mlc439,ORCIDS SP2021 Workshop,85011,5/15/21 22:54,5/15/21 22:54,Reflection: Looking at Peers' Workspaces of Student Work,"<p>Looking at my peer's workspace definitely caused me on to reflect on my own comments, notices and wonders. I asked myself: &quot;Did I just not notice items that my peers noticed and wondered? Were my comments based on certain look-fors or was I really open to what was the student was expressing? Was I limiting myself to just a &quot;pre-determined&quot; number of comments?  &quot; I determined that the answers were yes to all of the questions.</p> 
<br> 
<p>My peers and I typically noted similar notices and wonders. We commented on the student approach to solve the problem -- algebraic, numeric, graphical or words. I believe this is probably because teachers are comfortable using the Rule of 4 either consciencely or unconsciously. We also noted if the final answer was mathematically correct. Thirdly, we commented about the student’s starter numbers for the guess and check strategy as well as how the selection process was changed.  And finally, we commented on the use of mathematical vocabulary to explain their thought process.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I did note several interesting differences between us. The first difference I noted was that the question presented to the students was not the same question presented in module 1. My peers noted that 176 was the total number of beans used by the students. However, it was noted or wondered as a student decision. I believe that I noted the difference due to a teaching emphasis of answering the question asked. Another difference was classifying the error in a notice or wonder.  For example, Cheyenne S work is shown below.</p> 
<p style=""padding-left: 40.0px;"">x + x + 8 + 2x - 15 + 30 + (x ÷ 2) = 176<br>2x + 8 + 2x - 15 + 30 + x ÷ 2 = 176</p> 
<p>We all noticed the same point but expressed it differently. One peer noted the error as an order of operation error.  Another peer noticed it as an error with “x divided by 2”.  I noticed the error as combining like terms. My perception was that x divided by 2 should be ½ x with ½ as a coefficient. I believe a better notice would have been an order of operation error.  A third difference I noticed was regarding manipulating fractions. For example, Brian N stated:</p> 
<p>            “ 4x+x/2+23=176. After, I multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction”.</p> 
<p>Similarly, Destiny stated</p> 
<p>            “First, multiply everything by two to get rid of the fraction.”.</p> 
<p>Some of my peers considered multiplying by 2 was an efficient strategy to get rid of the fraction. However, “ I noticed that Brian N multiplied by 2 instead of adding 4 + 1/2. I wonder if understands that x/2 is equivalent to (1/2)x.” The final difference was the error in Alyssa M’s equation: 176=(1/2c+30)+(2c-15)+(c+8).  I did not notice the error. Only 1 of my collaborators noted “student didn't consider the amount of bean caleb ate”. However, we all commented through a variety of noticing and wondering that Alyssa M had difficulty solving the equation.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>By the way, I did just not notice things that my collaborators saw. When I reread the student work, I wonder how I could miss or not think was important. After reading my collaborators workspace I believe that there were several missed opportunities. I believe I had certain look-fors when looking at student work such as creating equations for Sol, Josh and Elsie based on Caleb, writing correct equations, for algebraic solutions -- the use of coefficients, combining like terms and solving equations.

 I think it is always interesting to look at how other colleagues evaluate student work, and valuable to look at how you evaluate others.

 One of the group members evaluated as though it was feedback versus noticing and wondering. I think there were similarities (noticing that students divided by 4, steps taken to find the correct answer) but the differences were that some did not give feedback about right or wrong answers and others had the noticing and wondering being directly related to a correct answer.  I would like to view more noticings and wonderings from the whole group.

Some of the things that we were attending to were similar -- for example, when students made unwarranted claims, I noticed a theme of wondering about how students came to such a conclusion. I noticed such wondering in (at least) two distinct categories of students' claims -- the first is when students produced answers (e.g. &quot;Sol was 57.&quot;) without providing a calculation that would jutify the answer, and the second is when students would make a process claim (e.g. &quot;I knew I had to start with 44 and then adjust from there.&quot;)</p> 
<br> 
<p>One thing I noticed some of my colleagues doing that I had thought about but didn't comment on was in tracking on similarities between student responses -- for example, wondering whether a particular group of students worked together, or whether one student might have shared a hint or strategy with another student. I certainly noticed similarities between student strategies, but didn't really try to track those similarities closely enough that I could make noticings about it (e.g. &quot;I notice that Student 3 and Student 7 used similar strategies.&quot;). This is where I wonder about the affordances/constraints of the online system - It would have been much easier to put student work in conversation with each other in an analogue setting by physically moving those two pieces of student work next to each other, or by sorting students into like-strategy groups.</p>",Module 3 - Part 2: Reflecting on EnCoMPASS DB,,,jtbrasel@umich.edu,Jason,Brasel,

<p>I'm interested in this noticing - I know for myself, sometimes when I'm looking for certain methods, I think I see an error in a student's work when actually they are just thinking about it in a different way and when I can catch myself and ask questions that give space for them to explain, I can actually understand their method. I want to think of myself as a teacher who locates student thinking and understandings so we can build on them, but I know sometimes my 'look-fors' get in my own way.

<br> 
<p>In my classroom, I've really made it a priority starting about 4 years ago to purposefully comment on the effort and work a student exhibits.  We celebrate the successes, of course, everyone likes it and feels good when we get the &quot;right&quot; answer.  But building that work ethic and drive to give maximum effort, though intangible and unmeasurable on a standardized test, is really an underlying benefit my students take away (whether they notice it or not).  I know most of them won't need the math itself later in life, but this trait they will.</p> 
<br> 
<p>I still recall the first year I began to consciously try to do this regularly and the reaction one of my honors students had.  I gave my algebra 2 students a graphing project at the end of the year.  I had very high expectations for it.  I was demanding precision and perfection of all the different functions we had covered throughout the year and showing how a, h, and k affect the graphs with several examples.  (It was a portfolio I wanted them to have to take to pre-calc).  I was hand-checking and giving feedback for each student.  One particular honors student kept getting it back with a close, but do this too.  Close, but do this too.  Really close now, but do this too.  After about the fifth or sixth iteration of one particular graph, she finally got it.  Well at this point, she was visibly frustrated as could be (being honors, she wasn't used to having to do things multiple times).  I got down on her level at the desk, looked her in the eys, and told her I was really proud of her for continuing to try, not giving up, taking the feedback into consideration each time, figuring out on her own when to move the opposite direction of the sign and when not to, and persisting so much until the final product was perfect.  She cried (good tears, grateful and happy ones).  It was a really powerful moment for all to see.  That moment sealed the deal for me.  It's a powerful practice, commenting on the work ethic and process and steps along the way, instead of the actual material.  </p>",Module 3 - Part 2: Reflecting on EnCoMPASS DB,85007,85007,dr.dlmckinn@gmail.com,David,McKinney,

<br> 
<p>As for the differences among us in deciding whether to phrase the comments we provided as notices or wonders, I'll be honest, I had a bit of trouble getting going with the EnCompass software, and I have read in others' reflections the same thing.  Some of my notices/wonders are simply mislabeled due to the novelty of getting to know the software.  I didn't know how to go back in and &quot;fix them.&quot;  So, I began writing each and every comment with I notice and I wonder, just to clarify, even if the big N or W in front didn't match what I meant.  I can imagine that if there were differences in your group about the same comment being a notice/wonder, it could easily be attributed to this type of &quot;error.&quot;  I can tell you were able to look beyond these distinctions though and focus on the essence underneath.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Your reflections about the process are very introspective and, for me, insightful.  I wonder, indeed, how much our training has us pre-programmed to have certain look-fors, and therefore miss other opportunities that might be fascinating.  One of my classes this year is a group of 9th graders who have never had good math training before, and since it's a small group and there's no expectation of a standardized test for them this year, I'm able to ask about answers they give to questions that just seem SO wrong.  When I give them a chance to explain their work, it's absolutely fascinating the mathematical thoughts and insights they have.  They truly have great instincts and intuition, and their answers are actually very thoughtful.  They usually have simply answered a different question.  It's provided so many opportunities this semester for looking deeply and purposefully into the doing of math for them in a visual way they never had, and that I've never been able to slow down and take time for.  </p>",Module 3 - Part 2: Reflecting on EnCoMPASS DB,85011,85011,dr.dlmckinn@gmail.com,David,McKinney,

That made me think about the discourse that students have about math. Sometimes I feel that as math teachers, we make several inferences about their understanding based on the work that we see them produce. However, if we can help them to be more precise when sharing their work (particularly when writing about it), we can better determine whether their understanding is procedural or conceptual. One of the math practices that comes to mind relates to developing arguments and critiquing reasoning of others' work. True conceptual understanding, and an ability to explain it clearly and concisely, allows students to develop mastery toward their ability to share their thinking and defend their work.</p>",Module 3 - Part 2: Reflecting on EnCoMPASS DB,84981,84981,pratser_d@hcsb.k12.fl.us,Devon,Pratser,

Our students become so focused on solving the problem that they barrel past the beauty of the math. They want to get the &quot;right&quot; answer. I find this to be especially true with my higher level students. One of the things that she suggested, which I've been implementing and have found is helping students to understand better the context, is asking, &quot;What's the story?&quot; When I ask my students about this, I require that their answers involve no numbers.

<p>I so agree that the folder structure will &quot;depend on the purpose of the organizational choice&quot;. How did your group decide on the purpose?  Did you all have the same purpose prior to discussing as a group?</p>",Module 4 - Part 2: Folder Structure Summaries DB,85168,85018,tujuanagh@yahoo.com,Hinton,Tujuana,

<p>I did not think of the ideal of the Rubric at all. I like the catagories:  &quot;<span style=""color: rgb(98,98,98);"">Beginning, </span><span style=""color: rgb(98,98,98);"">Emergent, and </span><span style=""color: rgb(98,98,98);"">Mastery&quot;. </span></p> 
<p><span style=""color: rgb(98,98,98);""></span></p> 
<p><span style=""color: rgb(98,98,98);"">Personal struggle with the levels. From this snap shot, how do you determine if something is a computational mistake because it is a rooker error or a content misconception. Additionally, if the logic is correct but the &quot;math&quot; is wrong, how would you catagorize?</span></p>",Module 4 - Part 2: Folder Structure Summaries DB,85170,85016,tujuanagh@yahoo.com,Hinton,Tujuana,
